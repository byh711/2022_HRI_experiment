# 2022_experiment: Human-Robot Interaction(HRI) Study

## 1. Project Background

The primary objective of this project is to delve deeper into human social cognition through human-robot interaction (HRI) experiments. The focus is on understanding the distinct features of a social interaction that make humans recognize they are interacting with an intelligent agent versus a machine. This understanding can pave the way for creating more "life-like" interactive AI in the future.

This research is an extension of ongoing studies over the past decade between the research director and collaborators in the United States and Europe. The aim is to expand this research network to Korea.

## 2. Research Objective

The study involves human participants interacting with a virtual avatar system developed during pilot studies. Participants will play a cooperative video game with the virtual avatar, unaware if they are interacting with a real human or an AI. The game in focus is "Don't Starve Together", a social survival game ideal for experimenting with interactive behavior during cooperative tasks.

The Social AI uses a Speech Dialogue system, linked to live game data, enabling it to react to in-game events through autonomously-generated speech using a text-to-speech (TTS) module in both English and Korean.

## 3. Hypotheses in the Repository

### H1: Planning vs No-Planning

This hypothesis tests the effect of the Social AI discussing future plans before executing them. The capability is based on machine learning models predicting future game states, which is then made available to the Speech Dialogue system.

- [H1(Planned Speech) - Korean](./setting/H1(Planned%20Speech)/KOR)

### H5: Bilingual Language Switching Effects

This hypothesis examines the impact of language switching in bilinguals on their social interaction with the Social AI agent. Participants will switch between Korean and English during the interaction.

## 4. Conclusion

This research aims to understand human interaction in a social environment and use this knowledge for the development of the Social AI. The ultimate goal is to identify components of social interaction that affect social fluidity.
